## About Me

üëã Hello! My name is Jamal. I'm a passionate Python developer with a keen interest in web development. I recently completed learning Python and have been exploring its various applications, including web development with Flask.

üêç I have a solid understanding of the Python programming language and can comfortably develop small projects using the Flask framework. Whether it's building web applications or handling HTTP requests, I enjoy leveraging the simplicity and flexibility of Flask to bring ideas to life.

üíª Additionally, I have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, which allows me to create simple and clean user interfaces for my Flask applications. I'm familiar with handling HTTP requests, which enables me to interact with external APIs and integrate various services into my projects.

üå± I'm continuously learning and expanding my skills, eager to explore new technologies and deepen my understanding of software development. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
